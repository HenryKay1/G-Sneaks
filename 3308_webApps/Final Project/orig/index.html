                Our database is designed to store user and sneaker, then keep track of sales transactions involving between users and the sneakers.User information  is added when
                they sign up for the service and sneaker information  is  added at our discretion.( hypothetically when we produce the sneakers, or buy from somewhere else.Now, a 
                user ( Sales man/woman) triggers a transaction when they purchase or or many products. Then that information is stored in our database as well.
                Below list below consists of detailed information of out 3 tables respectively.

            <p> I have a decent background with web design and web development. The most sophisticated work I did
                was a website where students can logon to, save their current course information,ask questions
                to other students in their class, answer questions, and react to other student posts, in a nutshell.
                I was able to learn a lot about web design  and development considering where I was before the project.
                However, I plan on learning more from web apps and this project.
            </p>
            <p>This Homework was quite helpful.I learned that when dealing with nested "div" elements, the flex attribute and its variants could be 
                very useful.Especially in my sales case, where I would have be displaying different sneakers on the product page, 
                which are most likely going to be nested "div" elements.
            </p>
